# Send & receive SMS messages

Learn how to send and receive SMS with Twilio with this code sample.
In just a few lines of code, you can see your phone light up sending and receiving SMS with Twilio.

## Prerequisites

To run the app locally, you need the following:

- PHP 8.3 or later
- [Composer][composer]
- An [ngrok][ngrok] account
- A [Twilio account][twilio_signup] with an active phone number that can send SMS

## Quickstart

1. Clone or download this repository.
1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`
1. Go to the [Twilio Console][twilio_console] and find your **Account SID**, **Auth Token**, and Twilio phone number.
1. Copy and paste those values into the placeholders in the `.env` file `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `SENDER`, respectively.
1. Set your phone number, in [E.164 format][e164_format] as the value of `RECIPIENT` in _.env_
   Save the file.

### Send an SMS

To send an SMS to the phone number that you set in .env, run the following command.

```bash
php send-sms.php
```

### Receive an SMS

Before you can receive an SMS, you need to complete a few further steps.

1. Start your ngrok server:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 8080
   ```

1. Go to the [Active numbers][active_numbers] page in the Twilio Console.
1. Click your Twilio phone number.
1. Go to the **Configure** tab and find the **Messaging Configuration** section.
1. In the **A call comes in** row, select the **Webhook** option.
1. Paste your ngrok **Forwarding** URL in the **URL** field followed by "/receive/".
   For example, if your ngrok console shows Forwarding "<https://1aaa-123-45-678-910.ngrok-free.app>", enter "<https://1aaa-123-45-678-910.ngrok-free.app/receive/>".
   - To receive an SMS **without** responding to it, append "no-response" to the URL
   - To receive an SMS and respond to it, append "with-response" to the URL
1. Click **Save configuration**.
1. Start the PHP app

   ```bash
   composer serve
   ```

1. With the PHP server and ngrok running, send an SMS to your Twilio phone number, containing whatever message you like.
   If you want a response, try sending "never gonna" as the message.
